## Details:

Tag Along is an app that offers a selection of restaurants specific to a users' preferences, and is unique in that it allows users to meet people nearby and connect over a shared cuisine interest. Users do this by either choosing to be a "host" which initiates an open invite for anyone willing to tag along to the restaurant of their choice, or they become a "guest" and request to tag along with a host. 

The idea behind this app is to help users explore local restaurants with an option of getting to know their neighbors.

This project is written in Swift for iOS devices.

## Features
- First time users are prompted to select their cuisine preferences which will be used to generate a random selection of restaurants for their choosing.  
- Users who decide to host a tag along can browse through a deck of restaurant cards where they will swipe right on a restaurant theyâ€™d like to dine in, swipe left on a restaurant to keep browsing, or shake their mobile device to switch between cuisines. 
- Users who want to tag along can select a host to request to tag along from a list of tag along hosts detailing the their information and restaurant of choice.
- Once the users have been matched they are able to message one another to make any planning arrangements for their tagalong.
