## Details:

Tag Along is an app that curates a selection of restaurants specific to a users' preferences.  It is unique in that it allows users to meet people nearby that share cuisine interests.  Users do this by either choosing to be a "host" or "guest" in a Tag Along.  Never dine alone again!

Tag Along was inspired by our instructor, who really hates to dine alone.

The app is unique in that users “shake” their mobile device to switch between cuisine preferences.  They are then given a selection of restaurant options of their selected cuisine type. Upon viewing these options, the user can then “swipe left/deny” or “swipe right/accept” on a restaurant choice. A sugWhen the user has confirmed their choice of restaurant and their preferred time, the user can choose to be matched with another user who has also chosen the same restaurant and time. The users will then be given the option to “accept” or “deny” dining together. If both users “accept” then they are both directed to information about their chosen restaurant (map of location, menu, hours of operation).  
Use Case:
Our app provides a quicker way to get a selection of food choices and gives users an option to meet a new person who shares their food preferences. We want users to have a quick and convenient way to choose where and what they are eating that day as well as meet someone new!
